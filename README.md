# Snake Game AI (freeCodeCamp Version)

This repository is a clone of the [patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch](https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch) project by Patrick Loeber, as featured on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel. All original code and ideas are credited to Patrick Loeber and freeCodeCamp.

## Objective

The main objective of this fork is to experiment with and improve the AI logic for the Snake game. As discussed in the freeCodeCamp video, the current AI agent can only progress so far before plateauing in performance. The video challenges viewers to try and enhance the agent's intelligence so it can achieve higher scores and survive longer.

I have cloned this repository specifically to:
- Understand the existing AI logic and its limitations
- Experiment with new strategies or algorithms to help the snake progress further in the game
- Document my findings and improvements

## Project Structure

- `game.py` - Core Snake game logic and environment
- `agent.py` - AI agent and training loop
- `model.py` - Neural network model definition
- `helper.py` - Utility functions
- `snake_game_human.py` - Play the game as a human
- `model/model.pth` - Trained model weights (if available)
- `arial.ttf` - Font for rendering text

## Next Steps

I will update this README with my approach, findings, and improvements after I have figured out a solution to make the snake progress further. Stay tuned for the final update!
